      <p>
        Throughout my undergraduate years, I was actively involved in diverse research areas within the biomedical sciences, which allowed me to cultivate a broad and interdisciplinary perspective. These experiences eventually led me to focus on the intersection of bioinformatics and basic medicine.

        I am especially interested in applying computational methods to investigate cancer-related genomic and epigenetic alterations, as well as the role of tumor immune infiltration. Looking ahead, I aim to contribute to the development of integrative bioinformatics strategies for understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.
